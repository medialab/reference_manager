Moreover, heavy-duty (HD) engines for trucks are facing stricter environmental legislation leading amongst other technologies to the introduction of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Whatever reduced emission technology will be applied, they all will significantly influence the engine tribology. This paper is dedicated to describing modern piston ring coating technologies to face the future diesel engine demands. The paper mainly focuses onto modern piston ring coating technology such as hard particle reinforced chrome plating, HVOF spraying and PVD. In particular, it will be discussed how thermal spray coatings need to be designed to find their position among established or future coating technologies of the competition."

They are creating a \"flat world\" within the Bureau, and within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. They are also working with their partners around the world to defeat crime and terrorism. They have joined forces with the Hungarian National Police to tackle organized crime syndicates in Eastern Europe.

It also launched anti-trust probes against London-listed Evraz Holding and Raspadsky Coal, while steel and coal giant Mechel saw its share price fall by half after the Federal Anti-monopoly Service knocked on its doors. But above all, the fall in the oil price has been as swift and brutal as its rise. The impact on the Moscow RTS stockmarket index has been painful; it peaked at 2487 as the price of crude galloped to new highs and now falls almost in line with every fall in the oil price. The cynics who said that the Russia story was about oil and nothing else must feel vindicated. What's more, some economists are predicting that oil will fall to $60-$70 a barrel, making the outlook for Russian equities grim. On the wider scale, America and Europe are considering various economic punishments for Russia's adventures in the Caucasus, including extreme options such as expelling the country from the G8."

The 'twin' deficits of the US also improved. The monthly trade deficit fell $1.6 billion to $55.3 billion in May, although part of the drop reflected a temporary dip in oil prices.

Personal tax revenue was up 16% (helped by payments on capital gains) and corporate taxes 41%, partly as last year's accelerated depreciation allowances expired.

Regional and community representatives will negotiate constitutional reform, but devolution discussions have been halted until after the regional elections in June 2009. The new federal government will implement an economic recovery package, which aims to encourage wage moderation and stimulate the economy. The budget deficit will rise to 4.7% of GDP in 2009 before narrowing moderately to 4.5% of GDP in 2010. Public debt will increase over the forecast period, reversing its previous downward trend. We expect private consumption and investment to contract in 2009, causing GDP to fall by 4.2%. The slowdown in domestic and foreign demand should ease moderately in 2010, but GDP will fall further, by 0.6%. Inflation will decelerate from 4.5% in 2008 to 0.7% in 2009 and 1.2% in 2010, remaining above the euro area average."

The two main sources of data were the federal Department of Employment and Immigration, and the Education, Science and Culture Division of Statistics Canada, which collects data from individual institutions. Discrepancies were found in the data from the two sources. The student statistical report includes sections on the collection and improvement of student data; characteristics of students with unknown residence status; enrollment patterns of Canadians and non-Canadians; major field of study for both categories; sex, age, and length of time in Canada; and country of origin of non-Canadians. The faculty report includes sections on the collection and improvement of faculty data; characteristics of faculty with unknown residence status; origins and distribution of non-Canadian faculty; citizenship and immigration status by subject taught; degrees earned by Canadian and foreign faculty; faculty rank; previous employment of university teachers; and age and year of first appointment. Substantial data tables are included. It is concluded that: student and faculty data reporting has improved in recent years; although the proportion of non-Canadian students has not changed greatly, that of landed immigrants versus visa-holders has been affected by immigration regulation changes; and the heaviest influx of foreign faculty has been from more established graduate schools in the United States and Europe.

          "value": "An analysis of the Canadian and Forbes Global Misery Indexes shows an average Canadian tax reduction of three points over last year. It also shows that the best of Canada--Alberta, Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut--got their level of tax misery down to the range of Texas, the US state where the total federal and local Misery Index is one of the lowest. However, the rest of Canada is between 14 and 26 points higher than Texas. (PEI has the highest Misery Index.) However, there is some consolation in the fact that no province has a higher Misery Index than New York state. Compared with the 28 countries and locations in the Forbes Global Misery Index, Canada does not benchmark favorably, with the exception of the small group led by Alberta. There are 12 countries and locations higher than the Canadian average, but 16 below it. Not surprisingly, the jurisdictions that placed higher than Canada in the Misery Index are in Europe, with the exception of China and New York; most of the lower ones are in Asia, including Australia, which has a substantially lower Misery Index at 88.5 points, or only two-thirds of the Canadian average. But the UK is at a higher level than Canada. This is caused by its unfavorable capital gains rate, which only decreases with time and then slowly disappears after a 10-year holding period. Although the Misery Index is a simple measuring tool, it is an effective one. It also corresponds to a more precise measure of the total tax burden by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which compares a country's total taxes at all levels of government to its gross domestic product (GDP). This percentage of total taxes to GDP is just under 29% in the US and 31% in Australia. It is 37.5% in Canada. And things could be worse: it is now more than 45% in France. The percentage of the Canadian economy, in terms of its gross domestic product, that is taken by the government in taxation at all levels for all taxes, increased one percentage point from 1999 to 2000 (the latest information available) and has been steadily rising from just 26% in 1965 and 33% in 1980. When will the increasing appetite for more taxes end?"

In the BAM-List’s 6th issue more than 400 substances are listed which are corrosive to the commercially used tank materials (unalloyed, austenitic CrNi- and CrNiMo-steels).Chemical companies, transportation providers and tank producers need tanks made of corrosion resistant materials. One possibility to solve the corrosion problems is to line the tank with a polymeric material, another one is the application of high-alloyed stainless steels and nickel-based alloys as there areX1NiCrMoCuN25-20-7 (alloy 926), X1NiCrMoCu32-28-7 (alloy 31) and NiCr23Mo16Al (alloy 59).The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), IKS Dresden and Thyssen Krupp VDM started an exposure test program with welded specimens in selected corrosive dangerous goods. The three high-alloyed materials were tested in substances representing 12 groups of dangerous goods like inorganic halogenides, organic acidic halogenides, halogenic carbonic acids, chlorosilanes, chlorates, perchlorates chlorites, hypochlorites, hydrogen sulphates, sulfides, sulphuric and nitric acids, chloric and perchloric acids, chlorosulphonic acids and phosphoric acids. The results will be incorporated in the 8th issue of the BAM-List to extend the numbers of corrosion-resistant tank materials"

Les cours du brut ont une fois de plus franchi le cap des 60 dollars américains le baril, tandis que le gaz naturel atteignait un nouveau sommet pour l'année avec une vague de chaleur qui déferlait sur le gros des territoires américain et sud-ontarien et faisait monter la demande d'électricité à des niveaux records. [Les] cours des métaux sont restés élevés et le cuivre a éclipsé son record de 1988. Le prix du blé n'a pu ajouter à son gain du mois dernier malgré l'âpreté des sécheresses qu'ont connues la plupart des régions d'Europe et l'Australie. Les prix des bovins ont remonté à la suite de la reprise des exportations vers les États-Unis. Les prix des produits fabriqués hors énergie ont fléchi en mai et en juin lorsque le taux de change s'est redressé après son léger dérapage au printemps. En juin, les ventes ont crû de 3 % sur le marché de la revente pour se situer à leur plus haut niveau de l'histoire. Lessor de la demande a fait que les prix de l'habitation l'emportent de 15 % sur leur valeur d'il y a un an; c'est leur plus forte hausse en 25 ans. La vigueur des ventes d'habitations neuves a gardé les mises en chantier résidentielles au niveau des deux millions de logements un troisième mois de suite, en hausse de 10 % depuis l'an dernier. D'une année à l'autre, le carnet de logements autorisés mais dont la mise en chantier n'avait pas démarré était en progression de 19% en juin, d'où l'impression que les pénuries se faisaient plus présentes dans l'industrie de la construction. Aux États-Unis, le double déficit s'est amélioré. Le déficit mensuel du commerce s'est contracté de 1,6 milliard de dollars pour s'établir à 55,3 milliards de dollars en mai, quoique cet allégement s'explique en partie par une baisse temporaire du prix des hydrocarbures. [Dans] les neuf premiers mois de l'exercice 2005, l'autre déficit, celui du gouvernement fédéral, a régressé de 24 % (77 milliards de dollars) par rapport à 2004 grâce à une vive croissance des recettes de l'État. Le produit de l'impôt sur le revenu des particuliers a augmenté de 16 % (partiellement grâce aux paiements sur gains de capital). Le produit de l'impôt des sociétés a gagné 41 % en partie parce que les déductions d'amortissement accéléré de l'an dernier ont pris fin. Par ailleurs, les dépenses, militaires et autres, se sont élevées de 7 %. Selon l'indicateur avancé, la forte croissance devrait se maintenir au second semestre. Lindice sera encore plus solide au moment de tenir compte en juillet d'une importante révision à la hausse de l'indice américain (voir les figures en haut de la page 3). Aux États-Unis, l'indicateur avancé a décru au cours de la dernière année, bien que le PIB ait continué à croître à un rythme soutenu de près de 1 % au deuxième trimestre. Le gros de la faiblesse constatée est imputable à une courbe plus raide des rendements, puisque la Réserve fédérale américaine a relevé les taux à court terme de leurs minima records et que les rendements obligataires se sont affaiblis. Le Conference Board, qui calcule l'indice américain, a modifié cette variable de sorte que des valeurs négatives ne soient enregistrées que lorsque les taux à court terme dépassent effectivement les taux à long terme. C'est ainsi que l'indice avancé d'ensemble a dû être fortement révisé à la hausse dans la dernière année. Dans son propre indice, Statistique Canada se reporte à la masse monétaire par opposition à la courbe des rendements.

Integration or dividend relief would be difficult for states to implement, acting alone."

The simplest way to describe federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen. Centralization is accepted reluctantly by federalism because it necessarily implies that decisions will be taken at a greater distance from the citizen. A federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them. In tandem with the development of the powers of the European institutions, their democratic character improved too. Overall, people now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the European level. EU political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organization. This article has set out to show that the essential institutional features of the European Union are based on federalism."

French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed polite interest. Britain, still allergic to the \"f-word,\" reacted with predictable scorn, and much of the rest of Europe responded with thunderous silence. Yet Fischer's call for an eventual European constitution and a full parliamentary federal system for the bloc - likely to almost double in size from its current 15 members in the next two decades - does coincide with a revival in debate about the \"finality\" of the unfinished European project."

The simplest way to describe federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen. Centralization is accepted reluctantly by federalism because it necessarily implies that decisions will be taken at a greater distance from the citizen. A federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them. In tandem with the development of the powers of the European institutions, their democratic character improved too. Overall, people now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the European level. EU political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organization. This article has set out to show that the essential institutional features of the European Union are based on federalism."

The European Union today is trapped in the contradiction of a monetary union that lacks the capacity to coordinate economic and fiscal policies.

          "value": "Germany's preferences regarding the kind of federal Europe it wants have been characterized by both continuity and change. While its preferences regarding (horizontal) institutional developments at the European level have remained relatively stable, its preferences on the vertical distribution of power in Europe have changed. Perhaps the most important shift has been the recent German push for a European federation modelled on a dual (competitive) federalist system in which competencies are divided vertically by policy sector, rather than on a cooperative federalist model in which decision-making power is shared across levels of government. This paper argues that this change had little to do with strategic considerations by the Federal Government about how Germany should position itself in Europe after unification. Instead it can largely be explained by the growing dissatisfaction with the performance of Germany's cooperative federalist model, in particular on the part of the German Lander who are seeking new ways to overcome centralizing tendencies inherent in both the German and the EU system of governance. By analysing German contributions to the EU's constitutional debate, the paper assesses the relative importance of norms, interests and ideas in shaping German preferences on the type of European federation it wants.

The contribution which an organized and living Europe can bring to civilization is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations... ...Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries. With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited, but decisive point: It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims. The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible... ...In this way, there will be realized simply and speedily that fusion of interest which is indispensable to the establishment of a common economic system; it may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by sanguinary divisions. By pooling basic production and by instituting a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and other member countries, this proposal will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation indispensable to the preservation of peace.\" Extract from the Schuman Declaration, 9 May 1950."

          "value": "This study assesses the political feasibility of national as opposed to supranational policy choices available to governments of advanced, industrialized democracies, focusing on the energy strategies pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the Netherlands. Ordering the empirical analysis are three central hypotheses: (1) The nature of \"energy\" as a public policy issue has undergone fundamental change, resulting in a significantly different decisionmaking process--i.e., rather than the \"incremental\" strategy which characterized energy policy throughout much of the postwar period, a more \"synoptic\" or comprehensive approach was pursued in response to the energy-related problems of the 1970s. (2) The consequence has been an increasingly complex domestic policy sphere which has precipitated greater uncertainty among policymakers. Under conditions of considerable uncertainty--greatly enhanced by growing international interdependence--traditional policy instruments may no longer be perceived to be effective in coping with energy-related problems. (3) As international interdependencies become more complex and tightly coupled, recourse to increased international management of mutual dependencies will be viewed by national actors as a viable alternative to the severance of interdependent relationships. Within the context of the first two hypotheses, German and Dutch energy policies were found to have experienced the most distinct transition from incremental to comprehensive. This tendency, however, was also evident in France, despite some forms of planning in various energy sectors as early as 1946-47. The effect was an appreciable increase in uncertainty among national policymakers, though certain differences were noticeable: in West Germany and the Netherlands, domestic conditions hindered implementation of major elements in the energy program, while international factors threatened to render other parts ineffective; in France, uncertainties arose primarily from external factors associated with extreme energy dependence. Regarding the final hypothesis, collaborative arrangements were initiated; however, there was substantial variation in the degree to which these international \"regimes\" circumscribed national autonomy: the energy R&D regimes institutionalized in the EC and IEA imposed few constraints on national actions; more demanding was the regime for long-term cooperation which evolved through the IEA and high-level summitry; the most restrictive regime involved the IEA's emergency program."

In 1966-72, The CSCE policy of the FRG evolved from a short-term tactical approach emphasising linkage and using the conference as a bargaining chip, towards a long-term strategic approach focusing on the substantive opportunities the CSCE offered.Â  One of the key findings of this thesis is the parallel nature of Ostpolitik and the CSCE.Â  In the CSCE context, the Germans began to pursue their own interests more assertively, and with skilful multilateralism took the lead in the making of Western policy.Â  On the one hand, the goals of German CSCE policy were defensive, keeping the possibility of change open.Â  On the other hand, they were proactive, focusing on small steps in cooperation and increased human contacts.Â  However, fundamental change, if any, was envisaged only as occuring in the very long term and only by consensus with the other side.Â  This thesis concludes therefore that during the early preparations of the CSCE, German policy was primarily aimed at making the Cold War more bearable, not at overcoming it."
