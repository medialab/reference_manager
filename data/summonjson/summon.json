                "Diesel engine development is continuously progressing: light vehicle diesel (LVD) engines are gaining in popularity in Europe and therefore we see a steady improvement in power performance and fuel consumption going along with increased loading of the power-cylinder components. Moreover, heavy-duty (HD) engines for trucks are facing stricter environmental legislation leading amongst other technologies to the introduction of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Whatever reduced emission technology will be applied, they all will significantly influence the engine tribology. This paper is dedicated to describing modern piston ring coating technologies to face the future diesel engine demands. The paper mainly focuses onto modern piston ring coating technology such as hard particle reinforced chrome plating, HVOF spraying and PVD. In particular, it will be discussed how thermal spray coatings need to be designed to find their position among established or future coating technologies of the competition."

                "A speech, delivered by Robert S. Mueller, III, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, is presented. Today he wants to talk about what the FBI is doing to protect the US' national infrastructure from crime and terrorism. He wants to talk about the value of working together and sharing information through programs like InfraGard. They are using technology to win the war against crime and terror. They are creating a \"flat world\" within the Bureau, and within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. They are also working with their partners around the world to defeat crime and terrorism. They have joined forces with the Hungarian National Police to tackle organized crime syndicates in Eastern Europe. In this era of globalization, working side-by-side is not just the best option, it is the only option. It is vital that Americans use their collective resources to protect their national infrastructure."

                "Commodity prices continued to trend up in July, although most of July's increase was confined to energy. Crude oil prices again broke $60 (US) a barrel, while natural gas hit a new high for the year when a heat wave in much of the US and Southern Ontario sent demand for electricity to record levels. Metals prices remained high, with copper eclipsing its previous peak set in 1988. Wheat prices could not add to last month's gain, despite intense droughts in much of Europe and Australia. Cattle prices recovered after exports to the US resumed. Prices for non-energy manufactured goods dipped in May and June when the exchange recovered from a small slide in the spring. In contrast to Western Canada, shipments resumed their downward trend in the central part of the country. They were off 0.7% in Ontario. Despite an advance in April, they have dropped 5% since January. This reflects the weakness in Ontario's exports, the only region to have posted a decrease so far this year compared with last year. The slump is confined to the paper and automotive sectors, but these are key areas: while they account for only three of the four commodities that have fallen among the top 25 exports, they represent 40% of the province's total exports. The 'twin' deficits of the US also improved. The monthly trade deficit fell $1.6 billion to $55.3 billion in May, although part of the drop reflected a temporary dip in oil prices. And the federal government's deficit in the first nine moths of fiscal 2005 was 24% (or $77 billion) below 2004, thanks to strong revenue growth. Personal tax revenue was up 16% (helped by payments on capital gains) and corporate taxes 41%, partly as last year's accelerated depreciation allowances expired. Meanwhile, both defense and non-defense spending rose 7%. Commodity prices continued to trend up in July, although most of July's increase was confined to energy.

                "The Economist Intelligence Unit's central forecast is that the current government, led by the prime minister, Herman Van Rompuy, and comprising the Flemish and francophone Centrists and Liberals and the francophone Socialists, will stay in power until the end of its term in 2011. Regional and community representatives will negotiate constitutional reform, but devolution discussions have been halted until after the regional elections in June 2009. The new federal government will implement an economic recovery package, which aims to encourage wage moderation and stimulate the economy. The budget deficit will rise to 4.7% of GDP in 2009 before narrowing moderately to 4.5% of GDP in 2010. Public debt will increase over the forecast period, reversing its previous downward trend. We expect private consumption and investment to contract in 2009, causing GDP to fall by 4.2%. The slowdown in domestic and foreign demand should ease moderately in 2010, but GDP will fall further, by 0.6%. Inflation will decelerate from 4.5% in 2008 to 0.7% in 2009 and 1.2% in 2010, remaining above the euro area average."

                "An analysis of the Canadian and Forbes Global Misery Indexes shows an average Canadian tax reduction of three points over last year. It also shows that the best of Canada--Alberta, Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut--got their level of tax misery down to the range of Texas, the US state where the total federal and local Misery Index is one of the lowest. However, the rest of Canada is between 14 and 26 points higher than Texas. (PEI has the highest Misery Index.) However, there is some consolation in the fact that no province has a higher Misery Index than New York state. Compared with the 28 countries and locations in the Forbes Global Misery Index, Canada does not benchmark favorably, with the exception of the small group led by Alberta. There are 12 countries and locations higher than the Canadian average, but 16 below it. Not surprisingly, the jurisdictions that placed higher than Canada in the Misery Index are in Europe, with the exception of China and New York; most of the lower ones are in Asia, including Australia, which has a substantially lower Misery Index at 88.5 points, or only two-thirds of the Canadian average. But the UK is at a higher level than Canada. This is caused by its unfavorable capital gains rate, which only decreases with time and then slowly disappears after a 10-year holding period. Although the Misery Index is a simple measuring tool, it is an effective one. It also corresponds to a more precise measure of the total tax burden by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which compares a country's total taxes at all levels of government to its gross domestic product (GDP). This percentage of total taxes to GDP is just under 29% in the US and 31% in Australia. It is 37.5% in Canada. And things could be worse: it is now more than 45% in France. The percentage of the Canadian economy, in terms of its gross domestic product, that is taken by the government in taxation at all levels for all taxes, increased one percentage point from 1999 to 2000 (the latest information available) and has been steadily rising from just 26% in 1965 and 33% in 1980. When will the increasing appetite for more taxes end?"

                "The BAM-List - Requirements for Tanks for the Carriage of Dangerous Goods - is used as the basis for the substance-related prototype approvals for tank containers and portable tanks designed for carriage of dangerous goods in Europe [1]. In the BAM-List’s 6th issue more than 400 substances are listed which are corrosive to the commercially used tank materials (unalloyed, austenitic CrNi- and CrNiMo-steels).Chemical companies, transportation providers and tank producers need tanks made of corrosion resistant materials. One possibility to solve the corrosion problems is to line the tank with a polymeric material, another one is the application of high-alloyed stainless steels and nickel-based alloys as there areX1NiCrMoCuN25-20-7 (alloy 926), X1NiCrMoCu32-28-7 (alloy 31) and NiCr23Mo16Al (alloy 59).The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), IKS Dresden and Thyssen Krupp VDM started an exposure test program with welded specimens in selected corrosive dangerous goods. The three high-alloyed materials were tested in substances representing 12 groups of dangerous goods like inorganic halogenides, organic acidic halogenides, halogenic carbonic acids, chlorosilanes, chlorates, perchlorates chlorites, hypochlorites, hydrogen sulphates, sulfides, sulphuric and nitric acids, chloric and perchloric acids, chlorosulphonic acids and phosphoric acids. The results will be incorporated in the 8th issue of the BAM-List to extend the numbers of corrosion-resistant tank materials"

                "Les cours des produits de base évoluaient toujours en hausse en juillet, mais le renchérissement de ce mois se limitait en majeure partie à l'énergie. Les cours du brut ont une fois de plus franchi le cap des 60 dollars américains le baril, tandis que le gaz naturel atteignait un nouveau sommet pour l'année avec une vague de chaleur qui déferlait sur le gros des territoires américain et sud-ontarien et faisait monter la demande d'électricité à des niveaux records. [Les] cours des métaux sont restés élevés et le cuivre a éclipsé son record de 1988. Le prix du blé n'a pu ajouter à son gain du mois dernier malgré l'âpreté des sécheresses qu'ont connues la plupart des régions d'Europe et l'Australie. Les prix des bovins ont remonté à la suite de la reprise des exportations vers les États-Unis. Les prix des produits fabriqués hors énergie ont fléchi en mai et en juin lorsque le taux de change s'est redressé après son léger dérapage au printemps. En juin, les ventes ont crû de 3 % sur le marché de la revente pour se situer à leur plus haut niveau de l'histoire. Lessor de la demande a fait que les prix de l'habitation l'emportent de 15 % sur leur valeur d'il y a un an; c'est leur plus forte hausse en 25 ans. La vigueur des ventes d'habitations neuves a gardé les mises en chantier résidentielles au niveau des deux millions de logements un troisième mois de suite, en hausse de 10 % depuis l'an dernier. D'une année à l'autre, le carnet de logements autorisés mais dont la mise en chantier n'avait pas démarré était en progression de 19% en juin, d'où l'impression que les pénuries se faisaient plus présentes dans l'industrie de la construction. Aux États-Unis, le double déficit s'est amélioré. Le déficit mensuel du commerce s'est contracté de 1,6 milliard de dollars pour s'établir à 55,3 milliards de dollars en mai, quoique cet allégement s'explique en partie par une baisse temporaire du prix des hydrocarbures. [Dans] les neuf premiers mois de l'exercice 2005, l'autre déficit, celui du gouvernement fédéral, a régressé de 24 % (77 milliards de dollars) par rapport à 2004 grâce à une vive croissance des recettes de l'État. Le produit de l'impôt sur le revenu des particuliers a augmenté de 16 % (partiellement grâce aux paiements sur gains de capital). Le produit de l'impôt des sociétés a gagné 41 % en partie parce que les déductions d'amortissement accéléré de l'an dernier ont pris fin. Par ailleurs, les dépenses, militaires et autres, se sont élevées de 7 %. Selon l'indicateur avancé, la forte croissance devrait se maintenir au second semestre. Lindice sera encore plus solide au moment de tenir compte en juillet d'une importante révision à la hausse de l'indice américain (voir les figures en haut de la page 3). Aux États-Unis, l'indicateur avancé a décru au cours de la dernière année, bien que le PIB ait continué à croître à un rythme soutenu de près de 1 % au deuxième trimestre. Le gros de la faiblesse constatée est imputable à une courbe plus raide des rendements, puisque la Réserve fédérale américaine a relevé les taux à court terme de leurs minima records et que les rendements obligataires se sont affaiblis. Le Conference Board, qui calcule l'indice américain, a modifié cette variable de sorte que des valeurs négatives ne soient enregistrées que lorsque les taux à court terme dépassent effectivement les taux à long terme. C'est ainsi que l'indice avancé d'ensemble a dû être fortement révisé à la hausse dans la dernière année. Dans son propre indice, Statistique Canada se reporte à la masse monétaire par opposition à la courbe des rendements.

The simplest way to describe federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen. Centralization is accepted reluctantly by federalism because it necessarily implies that decisions will be taken at a greater distance from the citizen. A federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them. In tandem with the development of the powers of the European institutions, their democratic character improved too. Overall, people now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the European level. EU political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organization. This article has set out to show that the essential institutional features of the European Union are based on federalism."

Britain, where fears of being ruled by Continental \"eurocrats\" have kept the country from adopting the euro as a common currency, is almost certain to be another major source of resistance. In Denmark, which has also refused to adopt the euro, politicians quickly denounced Schroeder's proposal."

The simplest way to describe federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen. Centralization is accepted reluctantly by federalism because it necessarily implies that decisions will be taken at a greater distance from the citizen. A federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them. In tandem with the development of the powers of the European institutions, their democratic character improved too. Overall, people now have something resembling parliamentary democracy at the European level. EU political institutions now look more like those of a member state than they do those of an international organization. This article has set out to show that the essential institutional features of the European Union are based on federalism."

                "Germany's preferences regarding the kind of federal Europe it wants have been characterized by both continuity and change. While its preferences regarding (horizontal) institutional developments at the European level have remained relatively stable, its preferences on the vertical distribution of power in Europe have changed. Perhaps the most important shift has been the recent German push for a European federation modelled on a dual (competitive) federalist system in which competencies are divided vertically by policy sector, rather than on a cooperative federalist model in which decision-making power is shared across levels of government. This paper argues that this change had little to do with strategic considerations by the Federal Government about how Germany should position itself in Europe after unification. Instead it can largely be explained by the growing dissatisfaction with the performance of Germany's cooperative federalist model, in particular on the part of the German Lander who are seeking new ways to overcome centralizing tendencies inherent in both the German and the EU system of governance. By analysing German contributions to the EU's constitutional debate, the paper assesses the relative importance of norms, interests and ideas in shaping German preferences on the type of European federation it wants.

                "\"World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it. The contribution which an organized and living Europe can bring to civilization is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations... ...Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries. With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited, but decisive point: It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims. The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible... ...In this way, there will be realized simply and speedily that fusion of interest which is indispensable to the establishment of a common economic system; it may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by sanguinary divisions. By pooling basic production and by instituting a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and other member countries, this proposal will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation indispensable to the preservation of peace.\" Extract from the Schuman Declaration, 9 May 1950."

                "The European Union (or the European Community) challenges both academic scholarship and political leadership by presenting a phenomenon that is rather unique in the international milieux. The integration of the twelve member states of the European Union questions the fundamental assumption of international politics, namely, the nation-state as the primary entity in the international system. This dissertation purports to expand our understanding of international integration by comparing the federal and national integration of Germany with that of the European Union By comparing and contrasting integration theories such as functionalism, neofunctionalism and federalism with intergovernmentalism the dissertation attempts to shed some light on the future course of the European Union. Such an exercise is conducted by examining German integration which began in early nineteenth century. German unification in the nineteenth century started with the building of a customs union which was the forerunner to regional confederal arrangements and finally the Bismarckian federation of 1871. The integration of the member states of the European Union closely resembles the patterns of German unification Furthermore, a close examination of the German federal system reveals that intergovernmentalism is not antithetical to federalism. The German federal system as designed by the 1949 federal constitution is characterized as intergovernmental federalism. An implication of this for international integration theory is that the differences between supranationalism--as espoused by functionalist, neofunctionalist and federalist theorists--and nationalism (as advocated by intergovernmentalists) can be bridged by emphasizing that intergovernmentalism can coexist with federalism and that they are not mutually exclusive categories. Thus, by delving into comparative politics scholarship on German federalism, this dissertation attempts to find a common ground for drawing parallels and to learn some lessons for international relations theory as it applies to the institutions and processes of the European Union"

                "This study assesses the political feasibility of national as opposed to supranational policy choices available to governments of advanced, industrialized democracies, focusing on the energy strategies pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany, France and the Netherlands. Ordering the empirical analysis are three central hypotheses: (1) The nature of \"energy\" as a public policy issue has undergone fundamental change, resulting in a significantly different decisionmaking process--i.e., rather than the \"incremental\" strategy which characterized energy policy throughout much of the postwar period, a more \"synoptic\" or comprehensive approach was pursued in response to the energy-related problems of the 1970s. (2) The consequence has been an increasingly complex domestic policy sphere which has precipitated greater uncertainty among policymakers. Under conditions of considerable uncertainty--greatly enhanced by growing international interdependence--traditional policy instruments may no longer be perceived to be effective in coping with energy-related problems. (3) As international interdependencies become more complex and tightly coupled, recourse to increased international management of mutual dependencies will be viewed by national actors as a viable alternative to the severance of interdependent relationships. Within the context of the first two hypotheses, German and Dutch energy policies were found to have experienced the most distinct transition from incremental to comprehensive. This tendency, however, was also evident in France, despite some forms of planning in various energy sectors as early as 1946-47. The effect was an appreciable increase in uncertainty among national policymakers, though certain differences were noticeable: in West Germany and the Netherlands, domestic conditions hindered implementation of major elements in the energy program, while international factors threatened to render other parts ineffective; in France, uncertainties arose primarily from external factors associated with extreme energy dependence. Regarding the final hypothesis, collaborative arrangements were initiated; however, there was substantial variation in the degree to which these international \"regimes\" circumscribed national autonomy: the energy R&D regimes institutionalized in the EC and IEA imposed few constraints on national actions; more demanding was the regime for long-term cooperation which evolved through the IEA and high-level summitry; the most restrictive regime involved the IEA's emergency program."

                "This thesis analyses the role of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the preparations for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the years 1966-72, with a particular focus on the multilateral Western framework of policy construction.Â  The thesis contributes to broader scholarly discussions on the history of dÃ©tente, of the CSCE and of German foreign policy.Â  Building on recently released documents from more than fifteen archives in seven countries, the thesis opens new vistas to the Western side of dÃ©tente.Â  It underscores the importance of looking beyond the bipolar surface of Cold War and dÃ©tente.Â  It also helps to highlight the interconnectedness of European integration and European dÃ©tente. In 1966-72, The CSCE policy of the FRG evolved from a short-term tactical approach emphasising linkage and using the conference as a bargaining chip, towards a long-term strategic approach focusing on the substantive opportunities the CSCE offered.Â  One of the key findings of this thesis is the parallel nature of Ostpolitik and the CSCE.Â  In the CSCE context, the Germans began to pursue their own interests more assertively, and with skilful multilateralism took the lead in the making of Western policy.Â  On the one hand, the goals of German CSCE policy were defensive, keeping the possibility of change open.Â  On the other hand, they were proactive, focusing on small steps in cooperation and increased human contacts.Â  However, fundamental change, if any, was envisaged only as occuring in the very long term and only by consensus with the other side.Â  This thesis concludes therefore that during the early preparations of the CSCE, German policy was primarily aimed at making the Cold War more bearable, not at overcoming it."
